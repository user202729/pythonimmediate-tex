# pythonimmediate-tex

A library to facilitate bidirectional communication between Python and TeX,
with support of manipulating TeX tokens as Python objects.

The TeX package is available on CTAN: https://ctan.org/pkg/pythonimmediate

The Python package is available on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pythonimmediate-tex/
with documentation on Read the Docs: https://pythonimmediate.readthedocs.io

------

Description of the TeX package follows.

> Just like PerlTeX or PyLuaTeX (and unlike PythonTeX or lt3luabridge),
> this only requires a single run, and variables are persistent throughout the run.
> 
> Unlike PerlTeX or PyLuaTeX, there's no restriction on compiler or script required to run the code.
> 
> There's also debugging functionalities -- TeX errors results in Python traceback, and Python error results in TeX traceback.
> Errors in code executed with the `pycode` environment gives the correct traceback point to the Python line of code in the TeX file.
> 
> For advanced users, this package allows the user to manipulate the TeX state directly from within Python,
> so you don't need to write a single line of TeX code.

### Internal note

`tex/` folder contains TeX-related files. The source code of the package is in `tex/pythonimmediate.sty`.

To create the documentation:

```
# sphinx-quickstart docs --sep -p pythonimmediate-tex -a user202729 -r '' -l en

rm docs/pythonimmediate.rst
sphinx-apidoc --full -o docs pythonimmediate
cd docs
make html
```

To autobuild the documentation

```
cd docs
sphinx-autobuild . /tmp/_build/ --watch ..
```

To create a tag

```
git tag 0.3.0
git push --tags
```

not that the output directory matters, just visit the documentation at `localhost:8000`.

Looks like it's not easy to write the docstrings in Markdown, see https://stackoverflow.com/q/56062402/5267751

There's some unresolved `$ is not defined` issue -- there's https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/9414 but it's unrelated

Maybe take a look at mkdocs/mkdocstrings later
