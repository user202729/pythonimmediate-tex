Welcome to pythonimmediate's documentation!
===========================================

This package is a Python-TeX binding. It requires the ``pythonimmediate`` TeX package to be installed.

The package works both ways -- you can run Python code from TeX, or TeX code from Python.

There are different sections of the documentation:

- :mod:`pythonimmediate.simple` -- interface that "just works" for typical users of the
  ``pythonimmediate`` TeX package, to use Python coding from TeX,
  who does not know TeX inner details such as category codes.

  Note that this should be read in conjunction with the ``pythonimmediate`` TeX package documentation.

- Some properties of the parent TeX interpreter can be accessed from :const:`~pythonimmediate.engine.default_engine`.

- The rest: contain functions to control the precise category codes of the tokens.

  Read :func:`~pythonimmediate.expand_once`
  and :class:`~pythonimmediate.NTokenList` for some examples.

- See the documentation of :class:`pythonimmediate.engine.ChildProcessEngine` for ways to create a TeX engine from inside Python,
  and explanation of the ``engine=`` optional argument for most functions.

- The command-line arguments that the Python component accepts
  (can be specified through the ``args=`` TeX module option)
  are documented in :mod:`pythonimmediate.pytotex`.
